# sample_gym_website

A small, fairly-contained HTML/CSS demo of a gym website. Website uses responsive design media queries to reposition website resources based on desktop and tablet/phone sizes.

Note that there are a few website resources (and multiple graphics files) which are pulled from online sites; an internet connection will be required to see all content.
